# Generate Realistic Human Face using GAN 

## Overview
The goal of this project is to build a generative model, in particular a GAN to create images of faces using the CelebA dataset that contains more than twenty thousand face images of celebrities with their attributes. To achieve this, the primary objective is to train the GAN to generate realistic-style images which are then realistically photorealistic with a focus on the realistic style portrayal of human faces in any conceivable emotion. GAN mainly includes a generator that generates synthetic image set and a discriminator that evaluates their authenticity. The generator enhances image production while the discriminator enhances the identification ability between the real image and the synthetic images during the Adversarial training. To evaluate the qualities of generated images, two indices, Inception Score (IS) and Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) will be used. Further experiments will focus on other attributes and features of the face including additional possible expressions to further demonstrate the versatility of the GAN synthesizing capability. This project facilitates the development of the existing field of generative modeling as it proves that GANs are efficient in the generation of high fidelity faces and assesses some of the capabilities of the network for mimicking intricate human features. 

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.9.6+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Celebe Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. # Clearing the unnecessary packages due to the dependency issues
%pip uninstall keras tensorflow tensorflow-addons -y

%pip install tensorflow scipy numpy pillow
